# My little programming history

An simple website made by me, not many features for now. Will be using to show off local projects and friends. Made by a Level 1 Autistic Person.

## Tools used & features

- HTML (yeah... why wouldn't I use it?)
- VERY little use of CSS 3. Still looks great tho ðŸ¤¯
- No JavaScript for now. (I didn't learn it for now...) will feature it later.
- Lots of pop culture references
- Provisory template. Might change in the feature
- In developement stages yet. Not Alpha!
- Visual Studio Code!!!
