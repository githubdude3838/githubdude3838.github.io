# My little programming history

An simple website made by me, not many features for now. Will be using to show off local projects and friends. Made by a Level 1 autistic person.

## Tools used \& features

* HTML (yeah... why wouldn't I use it?)
* VERY little use of CSS 3. Still looks great tho 🤯
* No JavaScript for now. (I didn't learn it for now...) will feature it later.
* Lots of pop culture references
* Provisory template. Might change in the feature
* In developement stages yet. Not Alpha!
* Visual Studio Code!!!
